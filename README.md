“Driving a Commercial Vehicle Bowtie Risk Visualization
Driving a commercial vehicle carries inherent risks due to long hours, heavy loads, and varying road conditions. The central risk is losing control of the vehicle, which can lead to collisions, injuries, or significant property damage. Threats such as driver fatigue, poor weather, mechanical failure, or distracted driving increase the likelihood of an incident. Controls like regular maintenance, driver training, fatigue-management programs, and telematics monitoring help reduce these threats. If an incident does occur, emergency response procedures and protective vehicle technologies help mitigate the severity of the outcome.
